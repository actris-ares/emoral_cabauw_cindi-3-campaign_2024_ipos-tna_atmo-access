# Dataset of aerosol optical profiles obtained with EMORAL lidar during CINDI-3 2024 Intercomparison Campaign within IPOS TNA of ATMO-ACCESS  

Dataset of aerosol optical properties derived from EMORAL lidar observations conducted from May 8 to June 24, 2024 funded with the EU H2020 ATMO-ACCESS Trans-National Access project entitled "Industrial Pollution Sensing with synergic techniques (IPOS)", conducted at the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR) of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). EMORAL lidar activity was contributing to the 3rd Intercomparison Campaign of UV-VIS DOAS Instruments (CINDI-3). Dataset contains aerosol optical properties profiles (particle backscatter coefficient, particle extinction coefficient, volume linear depolarization ratio, particle linear depolarization ratio) that were obtained using the Single Calculus Chain (SCC) of EARLINET-ACTRIS. ESA’s Mobile Raman Lidar (EMORAL) is a state-of-the-art lidar system developed through a collaborative effort involving the University of Warsaw (UW, Poland), Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU, Germany), National Observatory of Athens (NOA, Greece), Poznan University of Life Sciences (PULS, Poland), and companies such as Raymetrics (Greece), Licel (Germany), and InnoLa.
